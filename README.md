### My Programming Journey
Programming had always been something I was interested in, but for a long time I always considered it something that I
would do eventually. I manage a variety of different communities and I was gaining interest in creating my own systems.
One problem I have with community management programs written by other people is the design itself. I've always been a
big proponent of the idea which I have coined "advanced simplicity", where a program should be easy to use, but can be 
built on the specific use the developer initially intended to create something useful for anyone. 

My original goal was to make a program that would iterate through a list of arrays returned from an API and adjust roles
and the nickname of a user in a Discord server. While this is a relatively simple thing to do for me now, it was hard
for me at the time. I looked at other programs that were similar to my idea, but none of them adopted my design 
philosophy. Some were so simple to the point where they were near useless for my needs and others were unnecessarily
complex to the point where it was annoying to use and understand.

I ended up shelving my idea for a couple of months, then the pandemic happened. I had an excess of free time, something
that I didn't have before. I decided that it was finally time to sit down and build something. I dabbled with a couple
languages, but nothing felt right to me. Eventually, I discovered the Python programming language. There was just
something about it that just felt right to me, and in retrospect I found exactly what that is; Python adopts my
advanced simplicity philosophy. Python code has the ability to range from simple to complex based on the developer's 
needs and has a variety of use cases that could allow a developer to justify using it for more than a couple purposes
unlike a language like C#.

One thing I'd like to make clear is that I am not a natural-born programmer. I did not have any sort of programming
background aside from basic HTML (which is really a markup language), and I didn't know what I was doing. All I had 
was a desire to learn, and like every developer, Stack Overflow was my best friend. While I'm still actively learning
different packages/languages/etc, I'm finally in a position where I would consider myself a good programmer.

My main work is under an online pseudonym which I will not disclose under my legal name for privacy reasons, though I
may do so in the future. However, I will start posting my projects that aren't meant for use by my online persona here 
to build my professional portfolio.
